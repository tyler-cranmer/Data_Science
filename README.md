CSPB 3022 - Introduction to Data Science with Probability and Statistics

Fall 2020

DISCLAIMER: Do NOT use work in any dishonest way. This repository was created to track my software development progression. 

## Topics Covered

- Data Exploration and Probability
- Conditional probability and Bayes rule
- Discrete/continuous random variables and computing with distributions
- Joint distributions, covariance, correlation and sums of random variables
- Using Jupyter python environment
- Python tools for data science â€“ NumPy and Pandas
- Basic statistical estimation, random samples, bootstrap and resampling techniques, unbiased estimators and confidence intervals for measure data
- T-Test
- Linear Regression and classification
- Maximum likelihood estimation and analysis of variance

## Specific Outcome

- Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods and other sources of statistical bias, and determine their implications and how they affect the scope of inference. 
- Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis. 
- Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference. 
- Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions. 
- Model numerical response variables using a single explanatory variable or multiple explanatory variables in order to investigate relationships between variables. 
- Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon. 
- Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions. 
- Counting theory, Probabilities, Integration.
